\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\fs20\ul Known Issues: \ulnone\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\fs18
- Currently, the software may occasionally ask you for a large sum of money. Ignore it; it’s just confused.\par
- The feature to automatically solve world hunger is still in the planning stages.\par
- Sometimes the code just works and sometimes it doesn't, but hey, that’s part of the fun.\par
